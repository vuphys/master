Applying and optimising Total Generalised Variation filtering for FFC-MRI images

For lastest simulation, please run "monte_sim_x_all"

All data are stored in DATA

In DATA folder, datX_M_N.txt files can be used for data analysis. Each column demonstrates the value of random parameter.
The first column represents the index of created noise image from 1 to M. Each image will go through N random steps of simulation 
of TGV to get N denoise image.
